MeusPensamentosOpen
===================

PictureThoughts - Created for an iPhone Development class in May 2014 at UTFPR (Technological University of Paran√°) - Brazil.

Build it using iOS 7 (it may have some incompatibilities if built with iOS 8, like the Location Services)

The programs was created to teach the students the basic of building an iOS app from scratch. It started as a simple "Hello World" app to an app where they can take pictures, combine it with some phrases (or Thoughts), check the list of thoughts in the Map using Location Services and share it using the default sharing mechanism of iOS. It was built in 8 hours (some of the image mixing algorithms and the UI images were already brought ready).
